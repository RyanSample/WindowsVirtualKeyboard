# WindowsVirtualKeyboard
A virtual keyboard that can effectively replace the virtual keyboard already in windows.
##Goals
1. Create a virtual keyboard that is as easy to use as the virtual keyboard already built into windows.
2. Provide the same functionality with a virtual keyboard that a normal keyboard has, i.e., sending keyboard shortcuts.
